# Lung cancer cause of death classification

This React app implements a quick and simple way for reviewers to determine the cause of death for a patient in a lung cancer screening trial.

The algorithm is adapted from the NELSON authors [1]. This tool allows the reviewer to quickly track down the tree (hopefully with fewer errors) and also shows the path taken down the tree.
